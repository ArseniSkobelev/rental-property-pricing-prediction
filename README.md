### Introduction

The motivation for this project was to dive slightly below the surface level on a topic with such a widespread of information and knowledge as **AI.** My goal was to ensure that my recently acquired knowledge on the **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** basics ([Introduction to AI](https://course.elementsofai.com/) and [Building AI](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/) course curriculum provided by [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/)) wouldn't go to waste in the never ending pit of new technologies and concepts that I am invested in.

<br />

As I quickly understood, a one-of project with some kind of test dataset wouldn't do it to staple the knowledge once and for all _(or atleast the nearest future)._ I had to improvise and find a problem that at the same time was interesting for me and that I could solve quickly.
<br />
Another goal for the project was to ensure that the dataset it was based upon was gathered fully by me (me as in **Python** and **Beautiful Soup 4**).
